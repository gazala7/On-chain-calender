# Blockchain Calendar Reminders 📅

A decentralized calendar application that allows users to create, manage, and track reminders on the blockchain. This project combines the immutability and transparency of blockchain with the practical necessity of managing daily schedules.

## Vision 🎯

The Blockchain Calendar Reminders project aims to revolutionize how we manage our time and commitments by leveraging blockchain technology. Traditional calendar applications rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to downtime, data loss, and privacy concerns. By moving calendar management to the blockchain, we ensure:

- **Immutability**: All reminders and events are permanently recorded
- **Transparency**: Clear history of modifications and completions
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure
- **Privacy**: Users maintain complete control over their data
- **Interoperability**: Potential for integration with other blockchain applications
